Studying the Population Response Structure 
Studying the Population Response Structure Repository:

Explore the neural decoding of uncertain rewards in the parietal cortex, specifically area 7a. This repository:


Uses GLM to pinpoint units encoding task conditions like reward expectations and cue locations.
Visualizes population activity in reduced dimensions,
Implements shuffling tests, including a method by Elsayed and Cunninghum , to determine if population insights surpass individual unit analysis.
