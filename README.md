Studying the Population Response Structure 
Studying the Population Response Structure Repository:

Explore the neural decoding of uncertain rewards in the parietal cortex, specifically area 7a. This repository:

Analyzes PSTHs to understand unit behaviors and task parameter encoding.
Uses GLM to pinpoint units encoding task conditions like reward expectations and cue locations.
Visualizes population activity in reduced dimensions, inspired by [1].
Implements shuffling tests, including a method by Elsayed and Cunninghum [3], to determine if population insights surpass individual unit analysis.
This summary condenses the main points and objectives of the repository into a brief overview for users.
